need to reinclude the BSD wars.
need to include origins of Linux.
not sure what weeks those should go in
need to setup dir for sample files for work
need to figure out how much admin stuff to do

i promised to add in the advanced sed and awk slides, can probably steal from linux3, or the old, old archives, if the CVS server can be resurrected.
Need to link to a vi cheatsheet and to the o'reilly books.

Need a mention on the role of login shells -- maybe that should be first slide.
